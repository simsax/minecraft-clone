# minecraft-clone

Hi everyone!

Since spending several hours a day in front of a computer doing university stuff is not enough, I decided to spend even more hours trying to figure out how OpenGL works.
Not the best for my vitamin D intake, I know.
The goal of all of this is to make some kind of Minecraft clone or a basic voxel game engine. Obviously, I have absolutely zero experience with game development or graphics programming, so it's probably going to suckÂ (but it's fun, I guess).

I will work on this in my spare time and update this repo as I progress.
